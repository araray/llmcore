# src/llmcore/providers/__init__.py
"""
LLM provider implementations for the LLMCore library.

This package contains the modules that interface with various
Large Language Model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Gemini).
It defines a base provider interface and concrete implementations for each
supported service.

# This file intentionally left largely blank.
# Its presence makes 'llmcore.providers' a Python package.
# The BaseProvider class and specific provider implementations will be defined here.

# Example:
# from .base import BaseProvider
# from .openai_provider import OpenAIProvider
# __all__ = ["BaseProvider", "OpenAIProvider"]
