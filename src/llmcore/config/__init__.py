# src/llmcore/config/__init__.py
"""
Configuration module for the LLMCore library.

This package will handle the loading and management of configuration
settings for the library, leveraging the `confy` library and
a default TOML configuration file.
"""

# This file intentionally left largely blank.
# Its presence makes 'llmcore.config' a Python package.
# We can expose specific configuration-related classes or functions here later if needed.

# Example:
# from .loader import ConfigLoader
# __all__ = ["ConfigLoader"]
