  "description": "Grok 4 Heavy is not a single model but a multi-agent orchestration of Grok 4 designed to push the limits of AI reasoning. In Grok Heavy mode, multiple Grok 4.0+ agents tackle a problem in parallel and then cross-verify each other's solutions, akin to a 'study group' of AIs. This yields dramatically improved accuracy on the hardest tasks – Grok 4 Heavy was the first to exceed 50% on the rigorous HLE (Humanity's Last Exam) benchmark and even achieved a perfect score on the AIME 2025 math competition. It uses ~10× more compute than a normal inference, resulting in slower responses and significantly higher running cost (available only to Heavy subscribers via SuperGrok Heavy or enterprise plans, not general API). Grok 4 Heavy has the same interfaces (chat input/output, tool usage) but under the hood it's collaborating models. It's employed for ultra high-stakes queries where maximal reliability is needed. (No per-token pricing is public; access is via a $300/mo Heavy tier or special API arrangement.)",
