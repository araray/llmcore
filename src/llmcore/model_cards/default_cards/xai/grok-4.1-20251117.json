  "description": "Grok 4.1 is xAI's latest model, significantly improving emotional intelligence, creativity, and alignment while retaining Grok 4's analytical power. It underwent large-scale RLHF focusing on style, personality, and helpfulness, making it engaging and coherent in conversations. Grok 4.1 supports multimodal input (vision) and has integrated agent tools – it can perform live web searches, execute code, fetch data, and even generate images via an Agent Tools API. It holds the #1 rank on multiple human preference leaderboards in both reasoning ('thinking' mode) and non-reasoning modes. The model dynamically switches between Instant responses and extended reasoning (code-named tensor vs quasarflux) depending on query complexity. API usage is extremely affordable at ~$0.20 per 1M input and $0.50 per 1M output tokens, with only $0.05/M for cached prompts – making Grok 4.1 one of the most cost-effective frontier models. It outputs fewer hallucinations and more nuanced answers (e.g. demonstrating empathy in responses) compared to earlier Grok. Grok 4.1 is well-suited for general assistants requiring a mix of factual reliability and human-like emotional intelligence.",
