  "description": "ChatGPT 5.2 Pro (Extended Thinking) is the premium tier of GPT-5.2, capable of intensive, long-duration reasoning. In Pro mode, the model can think for very extended periods (minutes to hours) on difficult problems before finalizing an answer. It supports a user-adjustable 'reasoning_effort' up to Extra High, generating deeply considered responses with improved accuracy. Pro requires a specialized subscription (and initially was not API-accessible). It maintains the same 400K context window and core capabilities as GPT-5.2, but with substantially more internal computation (the model may produce large hidden chains-of-thought on the server). This mode is suited for high-stakes research and complex planning tasks, and matches or exceeds Gemini Pro on many benchmarks. (Pricing for Pro usage is typically higher or subject to special tier requirements; by default token rates mirror GPT-5.2 standard, but effective cost is greater due to extended compute.)",
