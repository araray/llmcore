  "description": "ChatGPT 5.2 is OpenAI's most powerful general model, featuring integrated step-by-step reasoning. By default, it 'thinks' through problems internally before answering, yielding highly reliable results. It supports up to 400K tokens of context and can optionally expose its chain-of-thought when higher reasoning_effort is specified. GPT-5.2 demonstrates a massive leap in reasoning and coding ability, roughly doubling GPT-5.1's performance on expert tasks. API usage is billed at $1.75 per 1M input tokens and $14 per 1M output tokens, with cached prompt reuse at 10% cost. This model is ideal for complex Q&A, multi-step workflows, and agentic tasks, combining extended context with advanced planning.",
