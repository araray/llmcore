  "description": "ChatGPT 5.2 Codex is a code-centric model designed for agentic coding workflows. It uses GPT-5.2 architecture but is fine-tuned for structured, deterministic code generation with minimal extra commentary. Codex 5.2 excels at transforming instructions into working code quickly, acting like a 'co-pilot' in an IDE. It supports long context (up to 400K tokens) for reading multiple files, and has specialized function-calling formats to integrate with developer tools. The model avoids verbose reasoning by default (no intermediate <think> steps in output) to prioritize execution speed. Pricing aligns with GPT-5.2 standard rates ($1.75/M input, $14/M output), making it cost-effective for large codebases. ChatGPT 5.2 Codex is ideal for automated code writing, refactoring, and agent-driven software tasks, supporting tool use like test execution or web browsing as needed.",
