# src/llmcore/context/__init__.py
"""
Context management module for the LLMCore library.

This package will be responsible for assembling the final context payload
sent to the LLM provider. It will handle token limits, Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) logic, and potentially Model Context Protocol (MCP) formatting.

# This file intentionally left largely blank.
# Its presence makes 'llmcore.context' a Python package.
# Key classes like ContextManager will be defined in other files within this package.

# Example:
# from .manager import ContextManager
# __all__ = ["ContextManager"]
